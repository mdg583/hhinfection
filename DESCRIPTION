Title: Secondary Infection Model Likelihood
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Matthew Gibson
Maintainer: Matthew Gibson <mdg583@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides functions to compute likelihood of secondary
  infections in households, based on final infection observations. It takes 
  observed outcome for household members (including missed observations),
  probabilities for primary infection of household members, household secondary
  infection rate and test sensitivity and specificity. The package also provides
  a fast method of pre-computing probabilities for the number of secondary
  infections for all possible numbers of primary infections and for all
  household sizes up to a given maximum size, for a given household secondary
  infection rate. The package includes some MCMC (Metropolis-Hastings) methods
  to aid in generating posterior distribution for household infection models.
